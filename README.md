COMP2007 Operating System and Concurrency

"The goal of this coursework is to make use of operating system APIs (specifically, the POSIX API in Linux) and
concurrency directives to implement a process management system like the ones you would find in common
operating systems. You will implement a scheduling algorithm like the one in Windows 10 and use multiple
queues (some of which will use the principles of bounded buffers) to model the system."
