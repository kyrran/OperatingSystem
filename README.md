# OperatingSystem

COMP2007 Operating System and Concurrency

"The goal of this coursework is to make use of operating system APIs (specifically, the POSIX API in Linux) and
concurrency directives to implement a process management system like the ones you would find in common
operating systems. You will implement a scheduling algorithm like the one in Windows 10 and use multiple
queues (some of which will use the principles of bounded buffers) to model the system."

## Requirements
• The implementation of data structures (e.g. process queue, process table) like the ones you would find
in real world operating systems (although slightly simplified here).

• The implementation of a “process generator”, long and short-term schedulers, a priority booster, and a
“termination daemon”.

• The implementation of a “Windows-10-ish” scheduling algorithm with pre-emption.

• The calculation of response and turn-around times.

• The simulation of processes.

• The efficient and correct synchronisation of data structures and code (where necessary).

• The integration of a visualisation module that shows when processes were running
